Title- Learn Probability Density Functions using Roll-Number-Parameterized Non-Linear Model

1. Methodology
   
The NO₂ air quality data is first changed by a non-linear function that uses a roll number. After transformation, statistical methods are used to figure out the parameters of a Gaussian-like probability density function.

2. Description

This project focuses on learning a probability density function for air pollution data.  A roll-number-parameterized transformation introduces non-linearity, and the transformed data is modeled using an exponential probability density function to capture uncertainty in air quality measurements.

3. Input / Output 

Input: 
NO₂ values from India Air Quality Dataset 
University roll number 
Output: 
Transformed variable (z) 
Estimated PDF parameters (μ, λ, c) 
Probability density function plot
